The Redcat Arsenal
==================

Redcat Arsenal is the newest tool to help speed up the process of post-installtion
setup for pen-testers and red teamers. It allows you to
download tools that are not already on your debian systems, in a faster and smoother way. 
I did extensive research in order to find the best, most affective tools that can help
red teamers get started faster, rather than researching for tools. The
Redcat Arsenal puts all of these amazing tools into one easy place for
you to install.

### Installation

**Disclaimer: MUST BE ROOT USER IN ORDER TO RUN THESE COMMANDS**

#### Run the sudo su command on your debian machine to get to the root user

`sudo su`


#### Clone the repo to the RedcatArsenal directory

`git clone https://github.com/hordyhordan/RedTeam-Arsenal.git`

#### Port the script to Unix device 

`sed -i -e 's/\r$//' scriptname.sh`

#### Install the Redcat Arsenal

`./setup.sh`

When you install this repo you will get 2 text files, RepoTools and
LocalTools. RepoTools will contain all the git repos of the tools for
your Arsenal, The LocalTools file containts the commands that you need
to install tools local to Debian systems. Feel free to edit these files and
add the tools that you want to them for smooth installations. The script
checks for duplicates so don't worry about getting errors or running the
same installs when updating these files.
